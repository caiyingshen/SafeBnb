##SafeBnb

SafeBnb is our final project for CS411 by team Number One Spimbot.
Collaborators:
Betty Shen (cs2)
Christopher Ho (cdho2)
Katie Ko (katieko2)

Our project aims to provide users with an easy way to determine if the airbnb
they are booking is safe. In addition, we allow users to provide more filters on
the reliability of the host to make sure that their booking is what they want.
